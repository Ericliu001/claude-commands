Please analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details
2. Understand the problem described in the issue
3. Use subagents to search the codebase for relevant files, but do not write any code yet.
4. **Think harder** and develop a plan. Outline each step clearly.
5. Present your plan to me and ask: "Does this approach look good? Any concerns or modifications before I proceed?". Wait for my response before continuing to the next step.
6. Create a new git branch and give it a branch name that follows the pattern: "Fix-issue(issue number)-name". Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue
7. Git commit with a descriptive commit message
8. Push the git branch to remote repository.

Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks.
